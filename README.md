**OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** Capture and extract text from images, such as signs, documents, or menus, and instantly translate it into your preferred language.

**Speech-to-Text:** Speak into your device, and the app will transcribe your speech into text and translate it into the desired language in real-time.

**Multi-Language Support:** Supports a wide range of languages for both text and speech conversion, giving users flexibility in communicating or understanding content across different languages.

Key Functionalities
**OCR Functionality:** Point your camera at text, take a picture, and the app will scan the image to detect text using OCR technology. The detected text can then be translated into a variety of languages.

**Speak-to-Text Conversion**: Use the microphone to speak in any language, and the app will convert your speech to text, which can then be translated instantly.

**Real-Time Translation:** After capturing or transcribing text, the app provides real-time translation into any language of your choice.

**Offline Mode: ** Translate previously scanned or spoken text even when offline (optional feature).

**Use Cases**
**Travel:** Instantly translate signs, menus, or documents in foreign countries using OCR or your voice.
**Learning:** Help language learners to understand and practice different languages with ease.
**Business:** Communicate with international clients or translate documents efficiently.
**Daily Use:** Use the app to understand text in a foreign language on the go, whether it's a product label or an instruction manual.


**Technologies Used**
**iOS: Swift programming language, UIKit framework**

OCR: Integrates Apple’s Vision framework for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to detect and convert text from images.
Speech Recognition: Uses Apple’s Speech framework to convert voice input into text.
Translation: Integrates with language translation APIs (such as Google Translate API or similar) for accurate and real-time translation results.
How It Works
Scan Text: Use your camera to scan text from images. The OCR engine processes the image and extracts the text.
Speak and Convert: Press the microphone button, speak in any language, and the app will convert your speech to text.
Translate: Once the text (from OCR or speech) is captured, select your preferred language for translation, and the app will provide the translated text instantly.
